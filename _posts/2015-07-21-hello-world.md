I found out about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and just created this blog. This is the mandatory *hello world* post.

I don't atually know what kind of content I will publish here... hopefully soon I will be writing soon about programming languages, compilers, interpreters, virtual machines and software engineering in general. I might even post stuff about other interesting topics such as: video games, music, books, art or Japan.

Just don't expect me to write too often.

```c
# include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

That's all for now. Time to find a nice theme and tune things up.

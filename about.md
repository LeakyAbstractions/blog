Hello! I'm Guillermo, a <del>code monkey</del> **software developer** from Zaragoza, Spain.
I believe in the **beauty** and elegance of small, uncomplicated code.
That's why I always try to keep things as **simple** as possible (but not simpler).
I like reading about **programming languages**, compilers, interpreters and virtual machines.
Sometimes I write about it too.

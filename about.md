Hello! I'm Guillermo, a <del>code monkey</del> **software developer** from [Zaragoza, Spain][ZGZ].
I believe in the **beauty** and elegance of small, uncomplicated code.
That's why I always try to keep things as **simple** as possible (but not simpler).
I like reading about **programming languages**, compilers, interpreters and virtual machines.
Sometimes I even write about it.

Besides computers, technology and geek stuff, there's **a whole bunch of things that interest me, too**.
Just to name a few: video games, music, books, movies, comics and art in general.
Oh and I love **Japan**: anime, manga, origami, calligraphy, food... you name it.
日本文化が大好きです。

I remarked to Dennis [Ritchie] that easily half the code I was writing in Multics was error recovery code. He said, «We left all that stuff out [of Unix]. If there’s an error, we have this routine called `panic`, and when it is called, the machine crashes, and you holler down the hall: **Hey, reboot it**.»

A program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it. Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and measure «programmer productivity» in terms of «number of lines of code produced». In so doing, they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: We should always refer to «the number of lines of code *spent*».

Hello internet! I found out about Jekyll and just created this blog. This is the mandatory *hello world* post.

Hopefully I will be writing soon about programming languages, compilers, interpreters, virtual machines and software engineering in general.
Just don't expect me to write too often.

{% highlight c %}

# include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

{% endhighlight %}

That's all for now. Time to find a nice theme and tune things up.

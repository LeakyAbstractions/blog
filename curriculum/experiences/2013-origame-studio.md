During 2013 I trained as a **3D application developer**. I learned **Unity3D**, an engine with which virtual reality
environments can be created for multiple platforms, computers and smartphones.

[**Kana Memory**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.origamestudio.kanamemory), an educational app to
learn Japanese, is the first Android game I published as an independent game studio.

Working at *Hewlett-Packard*, providing services for some of the largest banking corporations in Spain.

Most of the projects on which I took part, aimed for the integration of **CRM systems** (based on Siebel) and several
other external information systems. This was achieved by developing a layer of middleware based on web services.

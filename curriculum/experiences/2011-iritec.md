Working for *IriTec* as Senior Programmer. Some of the projects I participated on: 3SME (3.0 Social Media Ecosystem), an
automated analysis of the position and reputation of products, services, brands or companies in digital media, to
facilitate the process of decision making. This project was a collaboration with the
*ITA (Technological Institute of Arag√≥n*) and the *University of Zaragoza*. It was supported by the
*Spanish Ministry of Industry*.

Another project, for the Spanish company *Imaginarium*, involved the design and implementation of a system which
integrated several digital platforms, with thousands of registered customers.
